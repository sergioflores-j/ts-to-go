# ts-to-go

`ts-to-go` is a TypeScript utility library designed with a Golang flair. It provides a way to enhance error handling in your TypeScript applications. The main feature is a wrapper function that encapsulates both asynchronous and synchronous functions to return arrays containing both errors and results.

## Getting started

You can install any `ts-to-go` package using npm or yarn with as the following commands:

```bash
npm i @ts-to-go/wrapException
# or
yarn add @ts-to-go/wrapException
```

## How to Use

Please refer to each package documentation:

[@ts-to-go/wrapException](./packages/wrapException)
